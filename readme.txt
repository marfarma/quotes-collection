Quotes Collection plugin with Ajax powered Random Quote sidebar widget helps you collect and display your favourite quotes in your WordPress blog.

== Description ==

Quotes Collection plugin helps you collect, manage and display your favourite quotations in your WordPress blog.


**Features and notes**

* **Admin interface**: A nice admin interface to add, edit and manage quotes. Details such as author and source of the quote, and attributes like tags and visibility, can be specified. The 'Quotes' menu in the WP admin navigation leads to the quotes admin interface.
* **Sidebar widget**: The Random Quote sidebar widget with Ajax refresh feature -- you will be able to get another random quote on the same space without refreshing the web page. Following is the list of options in the widget control panel:
	* Widget title
	* Option to show/hide quote author
	* Option to show/hide quote source
	* Turn on/off the ajax refresh feature
	* Choose random or sequential order for refresh
	* Option to refresh the quote automatically
	* Show only quotes with certain tags
	* Specify a character limit and filter out bigger quotes
* **Shortcode**: Quotes can be displayed in a WordPress page by placing a `[quotcoll]`shortcode. Few examples are provided below. For more examples and the full list of arguments, please refer the [plugin homepage](http://srinig.com/wordpress/plugins/quotes-collection/) or 'other notes'. *(Note: as of version 1.5, the new `[quotcoll]` shortcode is introduced which uses the WordPress shortoced API. The older `[quote]` shortcode is deprecated, though it will still work as a measure of backwards compatibility.)* 
	* Placing `[quotcoll]` in the page displays all quotes.
	* `[quotcoll author="Somebody"]` displays quotes authored by Somebody.
	* `[quotcoll tags="tag1,tag2,tag3"]` displays quotes tagged tag1 or tag2 or tag3, one or more or all of these
	* `[quotcoll orderby="random" limit=1]` displays a random quote
* **The template function**: To code the random quote functionality directly into a template file, the template function `quotescollection_quote()` can be used. Please refer the plugin homepage or 'other notes' for details.
* Compatible with WordPress 3.0 multi-site functionality.
* The plugin suppports localization. Refer the plugin page or 'other notes' for the full list of available languages and the respective translators.

== Installation ==
1. Upload `quotes-collection` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the 'Quotes Collection' plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Add and manage the quotes through the 'Quotes' menu in the WordPress admin area
1. To display a random quote in the sidebar, go to 'Widgets' menu and drag the 'Random Quote' widget into the sidebar

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to get rid of the quotation marks that surround the random quote? =

Open the quotes-collection.css file that comes along with the plugin, scroll down and look towards the bottom.

= How to change the random quote text color? =

Styling such as text color, font size, background color, etc., of the random quote can be customized by editing the quotes-collection.css file.

= How to hide the 'Next quote »' link? = 

You can do this by turning off the 'Ajax Refresh feature' in widget options.

= How to change the link text from 'Next quote »' to something else? =

Change the value of the variable `$quotescollection_next_quote` on line 34 of the quotes-collection.php file.

= The 'Next quote »' link is not working. Why? =

Make sure your theme's header.php file has the code `<?php wp_head(); ?>` just before `</head>`. If you still experience the problem, [contact](http://srinig.com/wordpress/contact/) the plugin author.

= How to change the admin access level setting for the quotes collection admin page? =

Change the value of the variable `$quotescollection_admin_userlevel` on line 44 of the quotes-collection.php file. Refer [WordPress documentation](http://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities) for more information about user roles and capabilities.

= I have a long list of quotes, and `[quotcoll]` puts all of the quotes in a single page. Is there a way to introduce pagination and break the long list of quotes into different pages? =

Yes, pagination is supporterd in versions 1.5 and greater. `paging` and `limit_per_page` attributes can be used to achieve this. For example, `[quotcoll paging=true limit_per_page=30]` will introduce pagination with a maximum of 30 quotes per page.

= How about a feature to backup/export/import the bulk of quotes in CSV/text format? =

Such a feature will be available in a future version of the plugin, though no promises can be made as to when it will be available!

== The [quotcoll] shortcode ==
Quotes can be displayed in a page by placing the shortcode `[quotcoll]`. This will display all the public quotes ordered by the quote id.

Different attributes can be specified to customize the way the quotes are displayed. Here's the list of attributes:

* **id** *(integer)*
	* For example, `[quotcoll id=3]` displays a single quote, the id of which is 3. If there is no quote with the id 3, nothing is displayed.
	* This overrides all other attributes. That is, if id attribute is specified, any other attribute specified is ignored.
	
* **author** *(string)*
	* `[quotcoll author="Somebody"]` displays all quotes authored by 'Somebody'.

* **source** *(string)*	
	* `[quotcoll source="Something"]` displays all quotes from the source 'Something'.

* **tags** *(string, comma separated)*	
	* `[quotcoll tags="tag1"]` displays all quotes tagged 'tag1'.
	* `[quotcoll tags="tag1, tag2, tag3"]` displays quotes tagged 'tag1' or 'tag2' or 'tag3', one or more or all of these.
	* `[quotcoll author="Somebody" tags="tag1"]` displays quotes authored by 'Somebody' AND tagged 'tag1'.

* **orderby** *(string)*
	* When multiple quotes are displayed, the quotes or ordered based on this value. The value can be either of these:
		* 'quote_id' (default)
		* 'author'
		* 'source'
		* 'date_added'
		* 'random'
	
* **order** *(string)* 
	* The value can be either 'ASC' (default) or 'DESC', for ascending and descending order respectively.
	* For example, `[quotcoll orderby="date_added" order="DESC"]` will display all the quotes in the order of date added, latest first and the earliest last.
	
* **paging** *(boolean)*
	* The values can be:
		* false (or 0) (default)
		* true (or 1) -- introduces paging. This is used in conjunction with `limit_per_page` (see below).
	* For example, `[quotcoll paging=true limit_per_page=30]` will introduce paging with maximum of 30 quotes per page.
	* Note: if `orderby="random"` is used, paging is ignored.

* **limit_per_page** *(integer)*
	* The maximum number of quotes to be displayed in a page when paging is introduced, as described above.
	* The defualt value is 10. For example, `[quotcoll paging=true]` will introduce paging with maximum of 10 quotes per page.

* **limit** *(integer)*
	* The maximum number of quotes to be displayed in a single page ie., when paging is 'false'.
	* This can be used, for example, to display just a random quote. `[quotcoll orderby="random" limit=1]`
	
== The quotescollection_quote() template function ==

The quotescollection_quote() template function can be used to display a random quote in places other than sidebar.

Usage: `<?php quotescollection_quote('arguments'); ?>`
